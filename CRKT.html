<h1>CRKT Drifter</h1>
<h2>The CRKT Drifter shares the two basic characteristics of most of the knives: The blade is about 3 inches long, and you can open and close it with one hand. On paper, the Drifter offers nothing unique, but it excels at all of the small elements that make for a successful knife. The most impressive of these is the smoothness of the blade's pivoting action, which is among the nicest knives and on a par with that of knives costing four times as much. The Drifter's handle is contoured to fit both big and small hands, and it has a light texturing that improves the grip. This model has excellent fit and finish, and it doesn't have a cheap plastic feel like many of the knives in its price rangeâ€”usually costing under $30, it's a bargain.</h2>
