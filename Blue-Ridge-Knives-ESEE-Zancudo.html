<h1>Blue Ridge Knives ESEE Zancudo</h1>
<h2>If the Drifter isn’t available or if you’re looking for a real workhorse of a knife, here's also a Blue Ridge Knives ESEE Zancudo.1 Compared with the Drifter, the Zancudo has a larger handle, a stronger blade lock, and a lot more metal in the body. Those features, as well as the unusual and comfortable teardrop-shaped handle, make this model a great knife for tougher work and more aggressive cutting. I think that this added durability and performance are unnecessary for standard everyday use, and that the Drifter, with its adequate strength, lighter weight, and smaller footprint, is the better option for most. Still, the Zancudo is a choice for tougher jobs.</h2>
