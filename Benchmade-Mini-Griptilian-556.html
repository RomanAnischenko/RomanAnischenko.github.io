<h1>Benchmade Mini Griptilian 556</h1>
<h2>If you have a larger budget and want a knife that nails all of the little details, i recommend the Benchmade Mini Griptilian 556. Compared with my other picks, it’s simply a better knife—better pivot, better blade steel, better ergonomics, and better locking system. Because of the lock and the reversible pocket clip, this model is a fully ambidextrous knife. I believe that most people will be more than satisfied with the CRKT Drifter, but if you take good care of your knives and want one with premium touches, the Mini Griptilian is a great investment.</h2>
