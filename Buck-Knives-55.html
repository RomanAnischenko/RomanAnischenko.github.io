<h1>Buck Knives 55</h1>
<h2>I also looked for two traditional knives to add, and if you prefer a more classic look and style, i recommend the Buck Knives 55. Its design has an unquestionably age-old feel, but that comes at the expense of more modern touches such as a pocket clip, a one-handed open and close, and a textured handle. Still, the Buck Knives 55 has a very sturdy body and nice overall construction, which is evident in how the lock snaps open and closed. To me, the biggest drawback is that you need two hands to open and close this blade, but if youâ€™re okay with that, this Buck model is a fine choice.</h2>
