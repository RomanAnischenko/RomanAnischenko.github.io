<h1>Sanrenmu</h1>
<h2>If you’re new to knives and want to make the smallest investment possible to see if you like carrying one, i recomend like the Sanrenmu 710 (aka 7010). It’s similar in a lot of ways to mine main pick—it has roughly the same size and the blade pivot is almost as smooth. But the all-metal handle is less comfortable and can become slippery in damp or sweaty hands; i noticed this problem when holding the knife and when flipping the blade out. The good news is that the 710 is typically sold for under $20 and sometimes available for less than $10. This pricing is impressive seeing as the overall quality is better than that of many of the $20 to $40 knives.</h2>
